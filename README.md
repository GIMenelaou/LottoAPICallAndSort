# LottoAPICallAndSort
A slightly more advanced project using REST APIs and creating a local database that sorts and processes the fetched data.
The system communicates directly with the OPAP API, elegantly gathering information directly from the website.
It presents the winning column, the JOKER number, the prize categories, as well as the total distributed amount, the winning result in each category, and the profit of each win.
The system allows for a second option to search through the chronicles of draws, providing monthly statistical data. Statistical data is called and presented in a table that runs and is saved on runtime.
